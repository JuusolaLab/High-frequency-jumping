# Model
# Overview
Musca model for simulating photoreceptor and LMC responses for given input. As an example we replicate Figure 4b.

# Hardware requirements

The model needs enough RAM to store variables. 

# Software requirements

Tested and working with Matlab 2023b with Paraller Processing Toolbox and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

# Installation
Download code.
Run BurstyCalculationExample.m

# Example

BurstyCalculationExample.m contains script for running the both photoreceptor and LMC model for Figure 4b.
Bursty_stim_photo_hres_200.mat contains example bursty input used in figure 4 for the model.
